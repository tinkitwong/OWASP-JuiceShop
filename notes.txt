This is my writeup for OWASP Juice-Shop.
I did not include the writeups for challenges that were quick and easy to solve: mostly challenges with Stars 0,1,2.

======= Stars 1 =======

admin@juice-shop
admin123

# normal account
abc@hacks.com
abcde1


Challenge: Retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat in "melee combat mode".
1. Go to `PhotoWall` and we see an alt. text of failed-to-load img
2. Inspect element and right click on the img link
	a. Link:http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/%F0%9F%98%BC-#zatschi-#whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg
3. # is not properly url-encoded, and this causes the img. to fail to load
4. replace # with %23 to properly load the img.



Challenge: Meta Geo Stalking
1. Download John's Image to retrieve the meta data
2. Coordinates are 36.958717N 84.348217W
3. Google search results gives Daniel Boone National Forest

======== Stars 2 ========

Challenge: Visual Geo Stalking
1. In Photo Wall Section, download Emma's Image
2. Zoom in to the left, we see ITsec.
3. Go to Forget Password, we guess emma's email as emma@juice-sh.op
4. Guess password as ITsec

======= Stars 3 =======

Challenge: API-only XSS
1. Using Burp Suite, look at HTTP History after visting web pages.
2. Looking at js files with Debugger, we know there are /api/Products endpoints.
3. In Burp Suite, send one /api/quantity to repeater and change dest. to /api/Products/6 where 6 is the Pdt. ID 
4. Change the method to PUT to update the resource. 
5. Attempt to change the description value, but we need admin Authorisation Token. We can steal that after logging in as admin. (Done in previous challenges)
6. We then change the description to the following:
	{"description": "<iframe src=\"javascript:alert(`xss`)\">" }
7. Take note that we need to escape the quotations. 
8. Finish. 


Challenge: Admin Registration
1. OWASP API 
2. With Burp Suite running in the background, we register a user with normal priveledges.
3. Since we know there are more fields returned in the response than in the request, we can try to assign the fields that we want to change.
4. role:admin
5. Done


Challenge:  Bjoern's Favorite Pet
1. OSINT. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu0-kDdtVf4
2. bjoern@owasp.org
3. Security Question: Zaya

Challenge: CAPTCHA Bypass
1. Use Burpsuite to check out the pages loaded when loading the Feedback page and when submitting a Feedback. We get pages of the following paths:
	a. /rest/captcha
	b. /rest/use/whoami
	c. /api/Feedbacks
2. The response to /rest/captcha leaks the answer in JSON and notice that captchaId increments with step size of 1 each time a request is sent. So we can craft a bash script that curls this path to get the ID and answer.
3. We craft a POST request and embed the ID and answer fields, also take include a header for Content-Type to be applcation/json4. Iterate this 2 cmds 10 times in a for loop and we solve this Challenge.

Script used: captcha-bypass.sh

Challenge: Database Schema
1. Use Burpsuite to capture the pages when searching for a product at homepage
2. There is an endpoint that potentially interacts with the database
	a. /rest/products/search?q=
3. We can tinker with this:
	a. GET /rest/products/search?q=applke'))UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9%20FROM%20sqlite_master-- HTTP/1.1
	b. %20 is required for url to decode as space at server side.
	c. We are using UNION to query both applke and the sqlite_master schema
4. We get back a successful resposne from the database. We now know the TABLE column names.

{"status":"success","data":[{"id":1,"name":2,"description":3,"price":4,"deluxePrice":5,"image":6,"createdAt":7,"updatedAt":8,"deletedAt":9}]}

5. GET /rest/products/search?q=applke'))UNION%20SELECT%20sql,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9%20FROM%20sqlite_master-- HTTP/1.1
	a. This allows us to get the schema.



Challenge: Deluxe Fraud
1. Navigate to Deluxe Membership as a regular-permissioned user.
2. Inspect Element on Payment Button "Pay 49.00" and remove "disabled=true" together with the portion of the classname with disabled in it. Proberly has some js script that applies logic to disable the button.
3. Click the button with burpsuite running.
	a. POST Request is made. 
	b. {"paymentMode":"wallet"}
4. We can remove the value "wallet" and replace it with an empty string.
	a. And we get a success message back. 
	b. Apparently the server-side logic failed to check for empty payment modes. 


Challenge: GDPR Data Erasure
1. Just trying to guess Chris's email as chris@juice-sh.op and using SQL Injection for password as 'or 1=1-- fails. This is not surprising.
2. From the previous challenge, we were able to get the schema from SQL db
	a. One interesting table is: `Privacy Requests`
	b. "CREATE TABLE `PrivacyRequests` (`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, `UserId` INTEGER REFERENCES `Users` (`id`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE CASCADE, `deletionRequested` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0, `createdAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL)"
	c. "CREATE TABLE `Users` (`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, `username` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '', `email` VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, `password` VARCHAR(255), `role` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'customer', `deluxeToken` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '', `lastLoginIp` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '0.0.0.0', `profileImage` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '/assets/public/images/uploads/default.svg', `totpSecret` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '', `isActive` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1, `createdAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL, `deletedAt` DATETIME)"
3. We craft a SQL Injection as such to pull usernames and passwords from Users Table
	a. GET /rest/products/search?q=applke'))UNION%20SELECT%20id,username,email,password,5,6,7,8,9%20FROM%20Users-- HTTP/1.1
	b. Creds of chris:
		i. chris.pike@juice-sh.op
		ii. 10a783b9ed19ea1c67c3a27699f0095b

	c.

4. We log in with just chris email, adding '-- at the back to comment out the rest of the SQL checks
	a. This allows us to log in with any password
	b. eg: chris.pike@juice-sh.op'--
5. Done

Challenge: Login Amy
1. "One Important Final Note" is described as follows:
The example with “D0g.....................” should not be taken literally because if everyone began padding their passwords with simple dots, attackers would soon start adding dots to their guesses to bypass the need for full searching through unknown padding. Instead, YOU should invent your own personal padding policy. You could put some padding in front, and/or interspersed through the phrase, and/or add some more to the end. You could put some characters at the beginning, padding in the middle, and more characters at the end. And also mix-up the padding characters by using simple memorable character pictures like “<->” or “[*]” or “^-^”  . . . but do invent your own!

If you make the result long and memorable, you'll have super-strong passwords that are also easy to use! 
2. Also, we know amy's email address from the previous SQL injection
	a. amy@juice-sh.op
	b. 030f05e45e30710c3ad3c32f00de0473
3. Although we can bypass the password check by adding '-- to the back of her email, we do not pass this challenge as we ARE NOT logging in with her orginal creds.
	a. We need to find her password. 
	b. crackstation returns nothing on that hash.
4. After googling "One Important Final Note" -> We get led to this site https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm?id
5. From "One Important Final Note", we can swap out "D0g" with "K1f" [Her husband's name] and add periods "." to the end of it in GRC's Interactive Brute Force Password "Search Space" Calculator until it reaches 93.83 billion trillion trillion centuries as hinted in the Challenge Statment.
6. Login to finish the challenge.

Challenge: Login Bender
1. From previous SQL Injection, we know Bender's email address as bender@juice-sh.op with password hash as 0c36e517e3fa95aabf1bbffc6744a4ef.
2. Logging in as bender@juice-sh.op'-- allows us to bypass the password check
3. We can use ANY password to login. 
4. Done.

Challenge: Login Jim
1. Same as Challenge titled "Login Bender"
